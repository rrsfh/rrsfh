# Richardt Hansen
I am a PhD researcher at the University of Dundee, Scotland, specialising in Psychology. My research focuses on human cooperation and sustainable behaviours. Through experimental, laboratory-based social dilemmas, I explore how political identities, individual values and beliefs, and societal factors shape intergroup and intragroup cooperative behaviours.
